# T.O.C.  Java Game
Tower of chaos ( T.O.C.) is a simple 2D Java Game created using Netbeans IDE

## Introduction:
this is an university project in collaboration with Alessandra Donnini.                                                                                                     
This game is programmed in Java only and using the multi-language integrated development environment Netbeans.

## The Application "Thower of Chaos":
The Tower of Chaos application aims to provide an interface that through a graphic representation of a map causes the player to enter the tower.
the player's goal is to complete the tower by facing all the enemies that are on each floor.
Initially the user will be in front of the menu interface in which you will be able to select one of the following items:
 * Play: pressing this button the user is redirected to the character selection screen.
 * Exit: pressing this button exits the game, then the window it closes automatically.

Once the character has been selected, the player will be able to move freely on the game map using the following commands:
 * W = up;
 * S = down;
 * A = left;
 * D = right;
 * MOUSE SX = atk;
 * SHIFT = run;
 * 
## Achieved Goals:

below will be listed the goals of the application related to game actions and animations:

* the movement and actions of the character must be done through smooth animation.

* the user must be able to access the next tower level through a door only if the enemies of that level have all been defeated.

* The movement and actions of all NPCs (Non-Player Character) and enemies must be done via smooth animation.

* there must be a camera with focus on the player character.

* the user cannot exceed the map limits during the game.

* Presence of game music and sounds.

* maps are loaded randomly among those not yet explored by the player.

## Future Goals:
* Expand the number of levels (adding more floors to the tower).

* Add levels with boss enemies

* add NPCs and dialogues
